## Harvard CSCI E-3 Graduate Assignments

A significant part of the graduate student work for the Spring 2015 CSCI E-3 JavaScript programming class was to write new practice sets for future students. The assignments are meant to be short JSFiddle exercises that focus on key aspects of no-libary JavaScript and jQuery programming, with a difficulty level suitable for beginning programmers.
